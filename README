-----------------------------------------------------------------

To build this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

To use this module you'll need to have several features enabled
in your kernel. From the ipchains README:

--
This module will not (yet) work with the 2.3.x or 2.4.x kernel series.

If your kernel version is before 2.1.102; you need the ipfwchains
patch to the 2.1.x or 2.0.x kernel series.

You need to be running a kernel compiled with CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL (for
2.1.102 and above) or CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_CHAINS set to `Y'.  You can
tell that your current kernel is compiled with this by looking for
/proc/net/ip_fwchains' - if it exists, then your kernel is ready for
the ipchains utility.

--

To use features such as IP Masquerading, IP Forwarding, IP Aliasing, 
etc., you will have to also enable these individually in your
kernel configuration. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The IPChains.pm module was created to act as an interface to the
Linux IP firewalling routines so that one might set, list, or 
otherwize modify and/or access Linux firewalling rules and
information from perl, and to do so relatively painlessly.

As an example, if you wanted to deny all traffic from 
192.168.100.0/24 going to 192.168.1.0/24, and log all attempts,
you could create a rule as such:

$fw = IPChains->new(Source 		=> 	"192.168.100.0",
   		    SourceMask 	 	=>	"24",
		    Dest		=>	"192.168.1.0",
		    DestMask		=>	"24",
		    Rule		=>	"DENY",
		    Log			=>	"1"
	 	    );

$fw->append("input");

(Note that "input" is the chain you're applying the rule to., and
masks can also be written in the 255.255.255.0 notation).
Then, to list the results you could clear the options, set
the Verbose option, then call the list() method:

$fw->clopts();
$fw->attribute(Verbose, 1);
$fw->list("input");
		
Available options, attributes and syntax are listed in the POD
documentation contained in IPChains.pm. 

TODO:

1) Add a package to manage the logs generated by ipchains if the
   logging option is specified.
2) Possibly add more methods for searching through set rules and
   selecting/manipulating rules by search criteria.

BUGS:

No -S support quite yet. RSN.

! (invert rule) doesn't seem to work. Will be fixed RSN too.
